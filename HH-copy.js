  First, split the array by half until each array contains a single element.

  Next, compare sorted sets of elements and combine them in order to form a new sorted array.
  Continue this process until the entire array is sorted.

Given an array of integers, sort the array in-place and return the array.

use the array sort method built in to the array prototype while solving the
problem. The integers should be in ascending order from left to right.

We will sort the array using a strategy called selection sort, which works as
follows. First, put the smallest number in the array at position 0. Then, put
the second-smallest number in the array at position 1. Then, put the
third-smallest number in the array at position 2 etc. After going through the
whole array, the array will end up being sorted.

order. We take the kth number and insert it into the correct position amongst
the k - 1 numbers such that now, the first k numbers of the array are in
ascending order. In other words:

The first value in the array is considered to be already fine.
The second value is either placed before/after the first value.
The third value is inserted in the correct position amongst the first two values.
The fourth value is inserted in the correct position amongst the first three values.
